What's in the fridge today? A cooking reference system for spontaneous, fresh cooking—organized around ingredients, not recipes. No meal prep, no planning. Make delicious meals with what you have.

## The Problem I Solved

Existing recipe apps organize information in ways that don't fit my way of thinking in the kitchen.

They're built around individual dishes that require specific shopping lists. But my shopping list contains more or less the same core ingredients each time—I needed a way to combine them differently throughout the week.

I needed a system that would reflect how I naturally think when cooking: "I have chicken—what goes with chicken?" not "let's browse meal categories" or "what's my meal plan for Tuesday?"

So I organized my kitchen knowledge around ingredients, not recipes. Modular combinations that work with what I already have, designed for spontaneous, fresh cooking.

## How Cookflow Solves This

Cookflow organizes cooking knowledge by ingredient and technique. Instead of complete recipes, it provides modular combinations:

- `Chicken + lemon zest + oregano + olive oil`
- `✚ Serve: with roasted sweet potatoes`

I use techniques that work for cooking quickly and well, then vary the ingredients to keep our family meals balanced and interesting.

Every combination is designed to work with ingredients I already have, not what someone else planned for me to buy (aka recipe).

## Why I Built It This Way

My brain works in patterns and modules when cooking. I see ingredients as building blocks that combine in predictable and simple ways. This system reflects that natural thinking process.

The organization follows ingredient-first logic: start with protein, choose flavors, pick sides. Information is structured to match kitchen decision-making rather than cookbook conventions.

Categories reflect real cooking questions:
- "I have chicken" → Chicken section with flavor combinations
- "I need a side" → Sides section with quick options
- "I want something warm" → Soups and stews

## What Makes It Effective

**Ingredient-focused**: Organized by what you have, not what you might want to make  
**Modular combinations**: Mix and match based on availability and preference  
**Cognitive efficiency**: Information structured to match natural decision-making flow  
**Practical simplicity**: Essential information, clearly presented
