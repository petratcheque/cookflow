What's in the fridge today? A cooking reference system organized around ingredients, not recipes. It helps me cook efficiently fresh meals every day. No meal prep.

## The Problem I Solved

My shopping list contains more or less the same core ingredients each time. I needed a way to combine them differently throughout the week, rather than following traditional recipes that require specific shopping lists for individual dishes.

The system had to reflect how I think in the kitchen: "I have chicken—what goes with chicken?" not "let's browse meal categories."

Existing recipe apps organize information in ways that don't match this natural thought process.

## How Cookflow Solves This

Cookflow organizes cooking knowledge by ingredient and technique. Instead of complete recipes, it provides modular combinations:

- `Chicken + lemon zest + oregano + olive oil`
- `✚ Serve: with roasted sweet potatoes`

I use techniques that work for cooking quickly and well, then vary the ingredients to keep our family meals balanced and interesting.

Every combination is designed to work with ingredients I already have, not what someone else planned for me to buy (aka recipe).

## Why I Built It This Way

My brain works in patterns and modules when cooking. I see ingredients as building blocks that combine in predictable and simple ways. This system reflects that natural thinking process.

The organization follows ingredient-first logic: start with protein, choose flavors, pick sides. Information is structured to match kitchen decision-making rather than cookbook conventions.

Categories reflect real cooking questions:
- "I have chicken" → Chicken section with flavor combinations
- "I need a side" → Sides section with quick options
- "I want something warm" → Soups and stews

## What Makes It Effective

**Ingredient-focused**: Organized by what you have, not what you might want to make  
**Modular combinations**: Mix and match based on availability and preference  
**Cognitive efficiency**: Information structured to match natural decision-making flow  
**Practical simplicity**: Essential information, clearly presented
